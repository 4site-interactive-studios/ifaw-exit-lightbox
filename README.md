# IFAW Exit Lightbox

## How to use it

Just insert the `ifaw-exit-lightbox.js` script on the page where you want to show the lightbox on exit intent.

## Development

Your typescript code must be on the `src/app.ts` file. Styling changes must be on the `src/sass` folder.

## Install Dependencies

1. `npm install`

## Deploy

1. `npm run build`

It's going to create a `dist` folder, where you can get the `ifaw-exit-lightbox.js` file and publish it.
